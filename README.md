# Cancer Prediction App

### This is a BTech Project of my Undergraduate studies from IIT Jodhpur
In this app we mainly worked on the Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, which is affecting nearly 5 lakh individuals around the world. We basically designed a everyone friendly application, which gives us about the Clinical presentation, prognosis, Biomarkers to test, theur respective mutations, amplifications, and fusions, and make use of this data to suggest the available oncokb level of FDA approved therapies to Health care Professionsals.<br><br>
Also, the info at each specific button tells us about what it means, why it is useful, is it necessary and many more information, with provided reference for additional research, and a short youtube suggestions from our side to properly understand the cellular mechanisms involved by the genes.
